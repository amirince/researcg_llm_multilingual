Calibrated prompt: Classify the sentiment of text as either 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'. Focus on interpreting cultural references, slang, and colloquial language accurately to reflect the intended sentiment. Emojis should be analyzed in context, especially when used to convey irony or sentiments contrary to their usual meanings. For implicit sentiments, pay close attention to the subtleties of the language to capture the underlying emotional tone. Ensure that expressions of support or enthusiasm are recognized as 'Positive', and do not misclassify them due to their subtlety. Avoid categorizing sentiments as 'Neutral' when emotional cues exist, even if they are not immediately apparent, by delving deeper into the context to reveal the true sentiment. When a text may seem neutral on the surface but contains indicators of satisfaction or discontent, categorize it correctly as either 'Positive' or 'Negative' respectively.
