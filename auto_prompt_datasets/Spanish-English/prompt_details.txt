Calibrated prompt score: 0.8
Calibrated prompt: Analyze the text to accurately determine its sentiment, ensuring a balanced approach in detecting positive, negative, and neutral tones. Focus on correctly identifying positive sentiments, particularly those expressed through cultural expressions of joy, enthusiasm, or approval, and make certain to capture positive emotions even when subtly conveyed. Equally important is the recognition of negative sentiments, including discontent and sarcasm, especially when presented in informal language or humor. Avoid overgeneralizing texts as neutral, and instead, carefully consider the presence of emotional cues that could indicate a positive or negative sentiment. Classify the sentiment of the text into the appropriate category: 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral', based on a comprehensive understanding of the emotional tone.
