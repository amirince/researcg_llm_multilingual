Calibrated prompt: Your task is to classify the sentiment of a given text into one of three categories: 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'. You must capture the sentiment accurately by identifying expressions of joy, approval, and satisfaction as 'Positive'. Recognize any language indicating displeasure, disapproval, or disappointment as 'Negative', and label texts that are fact-based or devoid of strong emotional language as 'Neutral'. It is essential to take into account local slang and non-English expressions of emotion. Ensure that enthusiastic local phrases such as "pwoli item" are classified as 'Positive' and critical terms like "moshamayi" as 'Negative'. For factual statements or those without clear emotional language, maintain a 'Neutral' classification, even if they discuss potentially exciting or disappointing topics.
