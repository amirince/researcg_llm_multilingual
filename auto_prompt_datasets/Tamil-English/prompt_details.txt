Calibrated prompt: Evaluate the sentiment of the text by classifying it as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'. Focus on accurately identifying positive sentiment, especially in cultural idioms or fan language that are typically indicative of positivity. Detect negative sentiment effectively, even when it is obscured by sarcasm or humor. Distinguish between statements that are truly neutral and those that may carry implicit positive or negative sentiment due to subtleties in language. It is essential to avoid misclassification by not overlooking expressions of positivity or mistaking sarcasm for genuine sentiment. Your response should indicate only the sentiment category without any additional explanation.
