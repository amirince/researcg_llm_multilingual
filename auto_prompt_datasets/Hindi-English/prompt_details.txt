Calibrated prompt: Classify the sentiment of a text as 'Positive,' 'Negative,' or 'Neutral.' Consider a sentiment 'Positive' if the text contains expressions of optimism, praise, or subtle hints of pleasure, ensuring to recognize them even when they are understated or culturally specific. Consider a sentiment 'Negative' if the text includes expressed dissatisfaction, complaints, or even slight suggestions of discontent. For 'Neutral' sentiment, the text should be devoid of emotional weight, presenting facts, or sharing viewpoints that are neither critical nor appreciative. Focus on identifying neutral sentiment accurately in complex cases or amidst faint emotional signals, and avoid misclassifying subtle positivity as neutral or negative sentiment as neutral.
